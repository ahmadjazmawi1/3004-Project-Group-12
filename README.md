A medical device that generates Heart rates, calculates coherence scores, coherence levels, sum of the coherence scores, all in different sessions

Contains a graph that updates every second corresponding to heart rate. 
Has a feature to view previously created sessions and view the graph and metrics of each one, as well as the ability to delete them

Has a feature to reset the device, deleting all sessions from the device as well as the screen
Each session also has a breath pacer that tells the user when to breath in and out, leading to higher calmness and less stress and anxiety. 

The device also has a fully functioning battery that depletes 1% every 5 seconds. The screen also turns off when the battery dies, and must be charged to turn on by
pressing the charge button (thunder bolt icon).
